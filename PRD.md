## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

E-commerce businesses need efficient ways to create shipping labels for multiple orders simultaneously. Manually creating labels one-by-one is time-consuming and error-prone. A bulk shipping label creation system allows merchants to upload their order data via spreadsheet and generate labels for all orders in a streamlined workflow.

### 1.2 Your Task

Build a **Bulk Shipping Label Creation Platform** that enables users to:
1. Upload a spreadsheet containing shipping order data
2. Review, edit, and manage the imported records
3. Select shipping providers for each shipment
4. Generate shipping labels in bulk

The application should be a web-based platform with a clean, professional user interface.

### 1.3 What We're Evaluating

- **Creative Design**: UI/UX decisions, visual hierarchy, user experience
- **Technical Implementation**: Code quality, architecture, best practices
- **Problem Solving**: How you handle edge cases and data issues
- **Attention to Detail**: Form handling, state management, error scenarios

### 2.1 Core Concept

A multi-step wizard that guides users through the bulk shipping label creation process:

```

```

### 2.2 Target Users

- E-commerce store owners
- Fulfillment center operators
- Small business merchants
- Anyone who needs to ship multiple packages regularly

### 2.3 Key Value Proposition

### 5.2 Color Guidance

Use a professional color scheme. Suggested approach:
- **Primary Action**: Blue tones
- **Danger/Delete**: Red tones
- **Success**: Green tones
- **Warnings/Alerts**: Yellow/Orange tones
- **Backgrounds**: Light grays/whites
- **Active States**: Highlighted backgrounds

### 5.3 Table Design

- Sortable column headers (optional but appreciated)
- Alternating row backgrounds for readability
- Clear visual distinction for selected rows
- Status indicators that are immediately recognizable

### 5.4 Modal Dialogs

- Centered on screen with backdrop overlay
- Clear title and purpose
- Cancel and confirm actions
- Form inputs with labels

### 5.5 Responsive Considerations

While not required, consideration for different screen sizes is appreciated.

---

## 6. Data Flow

### 6.1 State Management

The application should maintain state for:
- Current step in the wizard
- Uploaded/imported shipment records
- Selected rows for bulk actions
- Selected shipping services
- Saved addresses and packages
- Running total calculation

### 6.2 Data Persistence

For this test, data can be kept in memory (no backend required). However, the architecture should be clean enough that a backend could be added.

### 6.3 Sample Data Flow

```
1. User uploads Template.csv
   ↓
2. System parses CSV and creates shipment records
   ↓
3. Records displayed in table (Step 2)
   ↓
4. User reviews, edits, fixes any issues
   ↓
5. User continues to Step 3
   ↓
6. System assigns default shipping service to each record
   ↓
7. User adjusts shipping selections
   ↓
8. Total price calculated
   ↓
9. User proceeds to purchase
   ↓
10. Success confirmation displayed
```
